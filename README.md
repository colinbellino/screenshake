# The art of screenshake

This project is a recreation (clone?) of the demo presented in the video "[The art of screenshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJdEqssNZ-U)" (by Jan Willem Nijman - Vlambeer).
This talk inspired me so much when i first saw it and i wanted to create a similar demo in Unity that i could use to teach people new to gamedev.

The code is pretty ugly right now, so maybe don't use it as a reference. Maybe later, i'll take the time to make it SOLID, add unit tests, etc...
The pixel art is bad too since i'm not an artist (programmer art ftw!) but i tried to stick with a style similar to the original demo.

_Disclaimer_: This is still a work in process and will change a lot in the following days.
